## Modeling Experiments
### 1. ARIMA Modeling
**Objective**: Forecast temperature, precipitation, and humidity using ARIMA.
- **Modeling process**: Data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- **Results**: Models showed reasonable performance but require fine-tuning for better accuracy.

### 2. LSTM Modeling
**Objective**: Forecast temperature using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- **Modeling process**: Data scaling, sequence creation, model training, and evaluation using RMSE.
- **Results**: The LSTM model showed good performance in training but exhibited overfitting during testing.

## Conclusion
Both ARIMA and LSTM models provided valuable insights into weather forecasting. While the ARIMA models showed limited performance, the LSTM model demonstrated potential in capturing complex temporal patterns in temperature data. Further feature engineering and model fine-tuning are needed to improve accuracy.

## Future Work
I will continue to refine the models, including addressing data preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance forecasting accuracy.
